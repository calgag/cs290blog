        <p>I have a lot of experience as a web developer, so this was incredibly easy. I did forget the syntax for the img tag so I had to look that up. I had already learned everything required for this assignment. I used w3 schools for looking up the img tag. Overall a very easy assignment! Which is nice, because I'm sure they'll get much harder.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
        <h4>April 4th, 2018</h4>
        <p>I have a lot of experience as a web developer, so this was incredibly easy. I did forget the syntax for the img tag so I had to look that up. I had already learned everything required for this assignment. I used w3 schools for looking up the img tag. Overall a very easy assignment! Which is nice, because I'm sure they'll get much harder.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 2</h2>
        <h4>April 23rd, 2018</h4>
        <p>Overall, this assignment was pretty easy. Unfortunately, I didn't go to lecture for a few days due to sickness so I was a little behind but the notes on the class website helped a lot. I think the hardest part was getting the twits to line up correctly. I love CSS because it can make a really crappy website look amazing, or vice versa. It can be dangerous a lot of the time. However, I do enjoy actually programming (like in an "actual" language) and I'm really looking forward to JavaScript for that reason.</p>

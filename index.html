        <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
        <h4>April 4th, 2018</h4>
        <p>I have a lot of experience as a web developer, so this was incredibly easy. I did forget the syntax for the img tag so I had to look that up. I had already learned everything required for this assignment. I used w3 schools for looking up the img tag. Overall a very easy assignment! Which is nice, because I'm sure they'll get much harder.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 2</h2>
        <h4>April 23rd, 2018</h4>
        <p>Overall, this assignment was pretty easy. Unfortunately, I didn't go to lecture for a few days due to sickness so I was a little behind but the notes on the class website helped a lot. I think the hardest part was getting the twits to line up correctly. I love CSS because it can make a really crappy website look amazing, or vice versa. It can be dangerous a lot of the time. However, I do enjoy actually programming (like in an "actual" language) and I'm really looking forward to JavaScript for that reason.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 3</h3>
        <h4>May 14th, 2018</h4>
        <p>This assignment was pretty challenging. JavaScript is one of my favorite languages just because it is so forgiving, but the actual programming part of the assignment was hard. I didn't really enjoy the creation of twits that much. It was
          just weird to have to write that entire thing by itself. I think that it would've been way easier and better if I could've just put in the inputs and out comes a twit, becaues that's all it needs. I did learn how to dynamically create stuff on
          the DOM though! That is super cool. I actually felt like I made a website. The class notes were very helpful to me in completing this assignment. I had to google how to see if a string includes another string for the search function.

        <h2>Assignment 4</h4>
        <h4>May 21st, 2018</h4>
        <p>This assignment was very easy in my opinion. I had some problems setting up the PORT environment variable due to not knowing my way around Windows's Command Prompt. That took some googling to figure out. But that was really the only small hiccup I ran into.
          Me and a friend worked together on it (not sharing code though). We both finished it in probably under an hour. Was overall very easy. I used the class notes posted on the website for help remembering NodeJS syntax, etc. I really enjoyed learning how a server
          worked because I've never worked with servers before, I've just had other people tell me what to do for the front end. Was really cool!

        <h2>Assignment 5</h5>
        <h4>June 4th, 2018</h4>
        <p>This assignment was pretty challenging in my opinion. I think the hardest part, for me, was to get the single twit pages to work. I still don't really understand why you just pass in twitData[ID] instead of having to assign it to the template variable. Took me a while to figure it out.
          In order to solve it, I looked at the example code provided in Hess's notes. It was an easy fix when I found it. I learned a lot about templating! I had never learned about that before so it was really cool. Like assignment 4, I feel like I can finally actually make a cool website
          now that I can templatize pages. I knew that something was going behind the scenes with databases in all big websites, but I didn't know how it worked. I used the notes and lecture to learn most of it. I think that more study is definitely going to be required if I want to keep up in future classes,
          because I kinda forgot the class's lecture after I left the lecture. Notetaking is also a problem. I will have to take better notes. I didn't really google anything; I just used the class notes.
